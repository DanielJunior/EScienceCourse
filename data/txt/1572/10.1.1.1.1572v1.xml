The vowels were taken from content words as well as function words. The results showed that the vowel triangles in speech to the infant were expanded compared to those in speech to adults, but only in the content words. For function words, the opposite pattern was found: adults produced more expanded vowels in adult-directed speech than in infant-directed speech. 1</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="4372"><clusterid>0</clusterid><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Joost Van De Weijer</name><affil src="SVM HeaderParse 0.2">Dept. of Linguistics, Lund University</affil><email src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">vdweijer@ling.lu.se</email><order src="null">1</order></author></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29582"><clusterid>1574</clusterid><authors>A Cutler</authors><title>Phonological cues to open- and closed-class words in the processing of spoken sentences</title><venue>Journal of Psycholinguistic Research</venue><venType>JOURNAL</venType><year>1993</year><pages>109--131</pages><volume>22</volume><raw>Cutler, A. 1993.
