The feature pixels composed of black changing elements and white changing elements are extracted directly from the CCITT Group 4 compressed document images. The connected components are labeled based on a line-by-line strategy according to the relative positions between the changing elements of the current coding line and the changing elements of the reference line. Word boxes are bounded by merging the connected components. A two-stage matching strategy is constructed to measure the dissimilarity between the template image of the user’s query word and the words extracted from document images. Experimental results confirmed the validity of the proposed approach. 1.</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="4341"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Yue Lu</name><address src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Singapore 117543</address><email src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">�luy@comp.nus.edu.sg</email><order>1</order></author><author id="4342"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Chew Lim Tan</name><address src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Singapore 117543</address><email src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">tancl�@comp.nus.edu.sg</email><order>2</order></author></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29265"><authors>A Amir,G Benson</authors><title>Efficient two-dimensional compressed matching</title><venue>Processings of Data Compression Conference, DCC’92, Snowbird</venue><venType>CONFERENCE</venType><year>1992</year><pages>279--288</pages><pubAddress>Utah</pubAddress><raw>A.
