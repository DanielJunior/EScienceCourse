The successful deployment of complex services, from both users ' and developer's points of view, require of a high degree of integration of a User Centered methodology with the design, development and usability tests in all the phases of the life cycle of services. An important example is Telefónica Móviles Portal de Voz (Voice Portal), a service providing information retrieval on a large number of issues using the voice or DTMF commands. With this objective, the purpose of SIS PRUEBA is to provide a single tool to integrate the characteristics of the unified processes of development (UP) with techniques of rapid prototyping like part of the usability methodology. Main benefits of SIS PRUEBA are: Definition and management of assigned components to usability projects (services, functionalities, use cases, types of users and use contexts). Creation of measurement libraries (questions, formats of answers and questionnaires). Allows for the quick production of batteries of usability trials by means of different experimental designs. Management of user panels for trials Administration of usability trials in supports of &amp;quot;paper and pencil &amp;quot; and/or remote (Internet). Emulation of voice interfaces on flow charts in design time.
