The foundry process was modeled using Pro Model to identify bottlenecks and evaluate machine performance, cycle times and production data (total parts, rejects, throughput, products/hr) essential for efficient production control. Results from the current system identified assembly machine work area as the bottleneck (although utilization was greater than 95% for two assembly machines) resulting in high work-in-process (WIP) inventory level, low resource and machine utilization. Based on these results, optimum numbers were identified through use of scenarios by varying the number of assembly machines and processing time of each machine. In addition to these scenarios, strategies for production control involving buffer sizes were also made.</abstract><year src="user correction">2002</year><venue src="user correction">PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE</venue><venType src="user correction"></venType><volume src="user correction"></volume><number src="user correction"></number><publisher src="user correction"></publisher><pubAddress src="user correction"></pubAddress><tech src="user correction"></tech><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="null"><name src="user correction">Sang D.
