In this paper, we explore the formation of a university-based education in modeling and simulation to meet the challenges. We examine the factors affecting the composition of a modeling and simulation course. Based on the anticipated consequences, we propose potential solutions. 1</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="4426"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">B. A.
