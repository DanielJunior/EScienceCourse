However, that is not to say that it is well understood. Renowned scholars continue to work with incredibly simplified models of an incredibly complex economy. Consequently, empirical results are usually carefully annotated with caveats noting the limitations of all findings and the great uncertainties that remain concerning fundamental assumptions in the field.</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29972"><authors>A Agrawal</authors><title>Importing Scientific Inventions: Direct Interaction, Geography, and Economic Performance,&amp;quot; mimeo</title><year>2000</year><publisher>MIT</publisher><raw>Agrawal, A.
