Due to no-arbitrage ar-guments, our set of investment opportunities increases and the set of possible equivalent martingale measures shrinks. Therefore, we obtain a modified mean-variance hedging problem, which takes into account the observed additional market information. Solving this by means of the techniques developed by Gouriéroux, Laurent and Pham (1998), we obtain an explicit description of the optimal hedging strategy and an admissible, con-strained variance-optimal signed martingale measure, that generates both the approxima-tion price and the observed option prices.</abstract><keywords><keyword id="1239">JEL classification</keyword><keyword id="1240">G11</keyword><keyword id="1241">G12</keyword></keywords><authors><author id="4184"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Frank Thierbach</name><address src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Adenauerallee 24–42; 53113 Bonn, Germany</address><email src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">thierbach@finasto.uni-bonn.de</email><order>1</order></author><author id="4185"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Frank Thierbach</name><order>2</order></author></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="28407"><authors>J P Ansel,C Stricker</authors><title>Décomposition de Kunita-Watanabe, Séminaire de</title><venue>Probabilitiés XXVII, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1557</venue><venType>CONFERENCE</venType><year>1993</year><pages>30--32</pages><publisher>Springer</publisher><raw>Ansel, J.
