This paper proposes the InstantGrid framework for on-demand construction of grid points. In contrast to traditional approaches, Instant-Grid is designed to substantially simplify software management in grid systems, and is able to instantly turn any computer into a grid-ready platform with the desired execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that a 256-node grid point with commodity grid middleware can be constructed in five minutes from scratch. 1</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="4295"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Roy S.
