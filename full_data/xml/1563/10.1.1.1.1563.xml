High species diversity, together with rarity, is a general trend in neotropical forests and coral reefs. However, the origin of such diversity and the consequences of food web complexity in both species abundances and temporal fluctuations are not well understood. Several regularities are observed in complex, multispecies ecosystems that suggest that these ecologies might be organized close to points of instability. We explore, in greater depth, a recent stochastic model of population dynamics that is shown to reproduce: (i) the scaling law linking species number and connectivity; (ii) the observed distributions of species abundance reported from field studies (showing long tails and thus a predominance of rare species); (iii) the complex fluctuations displayed by natural communities (including chaotic dynamics); and (iv) the species–area relations displayed by rainforest plots. It is conjectured that the conflict between the natural tendency towards higher diversity due to immigration, and the ecosystem level constraints derived from an increasing number of links, leaves the system poised at a critical boundary separating stable from unstable communities, where large fluctuations are expected to occur. We suggest that the patterns displayed by species-rich communities, including rarity, would result from such a spontaneous tendency towards instability.</abstract><keywords><keyword id="1273">scaling</keyword><keyword id="1274">species-abundance distributions</keyword><keyword id="1275">rarity</keyword><keyword id="1276">species–area relations</keyword><keyword id="1277">spatial dynamics</keyword></keywords><authors><author id="4354"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Ricard V.

Some analyse the dynamics of an ecological time-series and its possible origins (Schaffer 1984; Ellner &amp; Turchin 1995; Turchin &amp; Ellner 1998; Gamarra &amp; Solé 2000). Others explore the statistical regularities present in mature communities, such as the type of species–abundance relations (May 1975; Brown 1995; Maurer 1999) exhibited by diff</context><context>figure 3, where a smallspecies system (S = 30) has been used. Complex dynamical patterns are observable and in some cases they can be identified as deterministic chaos (Gamarra &amp; Solé 2000; Turchin &amp; Ellner 1998). In figure 3b we plot the reconstructed attractor obtained from one of the species timeseries. Using standard techniques of time-series analysis (Ellner 1988) it can be shown, for this particular ca</context></contexts></citation><citation id="29404"><authors>N G Van Kampen</authors><title>Stochastic processes in physics and chemistry</title><year>1981</year><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><pubAddress>Amsterdam</pubAddress><raw>Van Kampen, N.

In addition, this law was also found to be present in more realistic models (Pimm 1982) and has motivated many studies (Winemiller 1990; Polis 1991; Martinez 1992, 1994; Reagan &amp; Wade 1996; Montoya &amp; Solé 2002b). Further re-analysis of model networks with some amount of hierarchical structure revealed that a scaling law was present b</context></contexts></citation></citations><fileInfo><url>http://complex.upf.es/~ricard/philtransSOI.pdf</url><repID>rep1</repID><conversionTrace>PDFLib TET</conversionTrace><checkSums><checkSum><fileType>pdf</fileType><sha1>dfbd48459e8895d90ca4f0866d8a9aea5dc59736</sha1></checkSum></checkSums></fileInfo></document>
