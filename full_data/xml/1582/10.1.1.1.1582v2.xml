This paper presents an approach for applying balanced likelihood ratio importance sampling to the problem of quantifying the probability that the content of the second buffer in a two node tandem Jackson network reaches some high level before it becomes empty. Heuristic importance sampling distributions are derived that can be used to estimate this overflow probability in cases where the first buffer capacity is finite or infinite. The proposed importance sampling distributions differ from previous balanced likelihood ratio methods in that they are specified as functions of the contents of the buffers. Empirical results indicate that the relative errors of these importance sampling estimators is bounded independent of the buffer size when the second server is the bottleneck and is bounded linearly in the buffer size otherwise.</abstract><year src="user correction">2003</year><venue src="user correction">PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2003 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE</venue><venType src="user correction"></venType><volume src="user correction"></volume><number src="user correction"></number><publisher src="user correction"></publisher><pubAddress src="user correction"></pubAddress><tech src="user correction"></tech><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="null"><name src="user correction">Ramya Dhamodaran, et al.</name><affil src="user correction"></affil><address src="user correction"></address><email src="user correction"></email><order src="user correction">1</order></author></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29720"><clusterid>1633</clusterid><authors>C Alexopoulos,B C Shultes</authors><title>The balanced likelihood ratio method for estimating performance measures of highly reliable systems</title><venue>In Proceedings of the 1998 Winter Simulation Conference</venue><venType>CONFERENCE</venType><year>1998</year><editors>ed.
