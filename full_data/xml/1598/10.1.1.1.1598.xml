We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the number of loops in the Reeb graph that depend on the genus, the number of boundary components, and whether or not the 2-manifold is orientable. We also give an algorithm that constructs the Reeb graph in time O(¦¨§�©��� ¦), where ¦ is the number of edges in the triangulation used to represent the 2-manifold and the Morse function.</abstract><keywords><keyword id="1280">2-manifolds</keyword><keyword id="1281">Morse functions</keyword><keyword id="1282">level sets</keyword><keyword id="1283">Reeb graphs</keyword><keyword id="1284">loops</keyword><keyword id="1285">algorithms</keyword></keywords><authors><author id="4439"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Kree Cole-mclaughlin</name><order>1</order></author><author id="4440"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Herbert Edelsbrunner</name><order>2</order></author><author id="4441"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">John Harer</name><order>3</order></author><author id="4442"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Vijay Natarajan</name><order>4</order></author><author id="4443"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Valerio Pascucci</name><order>5</order></author></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29994"><authors>P S ALEXANDROV</authors><title>Combinatorial Topology.
