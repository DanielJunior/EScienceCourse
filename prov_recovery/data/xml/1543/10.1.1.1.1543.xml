This focus may be due to the fact that the group control problem can be reduced to well-established single-agent control problems by employing a leader-follower type control strategy. For example, single-agent path planning and trajectory generation techniques can be employed for the leader, and conventional trajectory tracking strategies can be employed for the followers. Indeed, formation control problems are much like linear systems theory: we search where the light is the brightest. It can be argued that formation control problems are the simplest type of coordination problems and that even if they were to be completely solved, the solution would be of limited usefulness since the formation concept is of limited utility. This last comment is supported by the observation that humans cooperate to perform a wide variety of tasks, yet we rarely maintain formation with each other. The usefulness of cooperative control technologies will be greatly enhanced</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors><author id="4305"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Wei Ren</name><address src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Utah 84602</address><email src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">{weiren</email><order>1</order></author><author id="4306"><name src="SVM HeaderParse 0.1">Al W.

The motion of each vehicle is causally dependent on the dynamic states of the virtual structure, therefore the states of the virtual structure are the coordination variables. In [27] a team of autonomous underwater vehicles are controlled to swarm around a desired mean location of the team with a specified standard deviation.
