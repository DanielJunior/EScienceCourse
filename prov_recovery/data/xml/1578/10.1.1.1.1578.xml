Whereas CT provides high spatial resolution, PET detects malignant lesions with high sensitivity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of PET/CT image fusion in the diagnostic workup of pancreatic cancer. Methods: One hundred four patients with suspected pancreatic lesion underwent triple-phase multidetector CT and 18F-FDG PET scanning. Voxel-based retrospective registration and fusion of CT and PET were performed with recently developed software. CT, PET, and fused images were assessed by 2 radiologists with regard to the detection of malignancies, possible infiltration of adjacent tissue or lymph nodes, or distant metastases. Results: Fusion of CT and PET images was technically successful in 96.2%. In 2 cases, paraaortic lymph node infiltration was detected only by image fusion; in a further 8 cases, lymph node metastases were confirmed with improved localization.</abstract><keywords></keywords><authors></authors><citations src="ParsCit 1.0"><citation id="29651"><authors>D Malka,P Hammel,F Maire</authors><title>et al.
